Adds some 9x39 weapons, using Kaiju-api.

Important Notes:
    Requires Kaiju-api in order to function.

What this mod adds:
    *MK9 - A Mutant chambered in 9x39:
         - Based off of the Mk47 from Le Kaiju's Advanced Modding mod
         - Accepts VSS 10R, 20R, and the SR3M magazines
         - Accepts all the same mods as Kaiju's Mk47, except I added my own barrels
         - Weapon and barrels available at Peacekeeper Lvl 2, since you won't have access to mags and ammo right away anyways
    *SKS-9x39 - A OP-SKS chambered in 9x39:
         - Accepts a custom 7 round internal magazine sold by Peacekeeper Lvl 1
         - Also accepts the VSS 10R, 20R, and SR3M magazines
         - Available at Peacekeeper Lvl 1, just in case you find some ammo early since you will have a magazine available
    *APS-9x39 - A APS chambered in 9x39:
      (Turned off in config by default becuase the ammo sticks through the mag, you can switch it to true if you are okay with that)
         - Uses a custom 12 round aps magazine sold by peacekeeper lvl 1
         - Available at peacekeeper Lvl 1, just in case you find some ammo early since you will have a magazine available

How to install:
        Install Kaiju-api
